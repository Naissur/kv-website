## Pitch, font, typographics, 2 years, business, meeting, music, work, money.

What is a **pitch**? Can you explain the structure and goals of your business in 30 seconds?
Having such constraints, you don't think immediately of unimportant details, and **communicate the inner meaning**.

The same happens when a drummer is given a constrain of playing a solo only on a smaller tom, and a kick.
Immediately, there is a central groove (**idea**), which is wrapped with details afterwards.

Hence, the structure of a **perfectly pitched** business fits :)

The meeting is going to be terrific. With blackjack, Erlang/OTP, and Elixir.

## How to pitch Erlang in a few sentences:

There used to be a set of problems 20 years ago: **programming fault-tolarant, non-fragile software is damn hard**.
Hence, guys from Erlang were intrigued, and solved it in their language.

Sounds interesting, right? (**Especially after 20 years of programming in C++**)

The meeting is going to be terrific. With plans, programmming and coffee.
Just like in the passing light of day.

Plans for today:

- Make my ideas known somewhere (doing it right now)
- Finish the Features List for persanal accounting app
- Look for a job
