## Conference, badly-designed, waste of time, non-waste of time, communication, feedback, I need it, problems, depression

Not a well-designed Erlang conference. I feel it was a pretty much complete waste of time :(

After all we're in Russia. Can anyone change the world?

Not considering butterfly effect. I am concerned with a goal-oriented, world-changing projects.
*Lean startup* has some great ideas, one of which is:


### We create too much, changing too little.
### Can we manage this?

By being as *economical and scientific as possible*, yes!
The scientific process is:

### Formulate hypothesis.
### create -> test hypothesis -> change direction in loop.

This is analogous to the following:
What is a difference between launching a rocket, and driving a car? *Purpose*.

*You do not need to know the specific combination of steering wheel turns to drive yourself to some place*.
But, we do it all the time in startup culture. Time to create, test, and change a new directions :)
