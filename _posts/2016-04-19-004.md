# Goals, tasks, profit, money, finances, Hong-Kong, future, choice

## What are my goals for the near future?

- Take a test trip to Hong-Kong
- For that, I need to earn ~50,000 RUB ~= 850.00 USD
- The **simplest and most efficient** way is to invest 80% of effort into a job, and 20% - into personal business
- Make a deadline on personal, and work-related goals


From some point of view, *everything is boring* because it takes some time to accomplish, and some effort to invest.
But great creations aren't an immediate result of taking time and putting effort.

The real art is making the following arrow happen:

Minimal time + minimal effort **â†’** product of maximum greateness.
