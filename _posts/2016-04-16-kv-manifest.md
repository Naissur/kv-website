We are a company of two colleagues.

We make predictable full-stack websites, with predictable deadlines, and resources.

## OUR PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS

- **Clarity in communication**
- Use **battle-tested tools and methods**
- Eliminate **painful spots**
- We make predictable **business**. That means: we make a tool for **solving a specific problem**
- **Business** >= product + clients
- **Programming** is, first of all, a tool, solving a problem.
- **Problems** are solved in the **most efficient way possible**, in accordance with this manifesto.
- **Client's problem** is an optimization problem with **objective criteria**.
- **Problem criteria**: *bounded, predictable* risks and *unbounded, unpredictable benefits*
- When this document fails to resolve a conflict, the decision is first made by the client, then by the CEO.
