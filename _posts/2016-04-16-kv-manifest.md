This **manifesto** is a dynamic conflicts resolution, and decision making instrument of KV company.

## US

We are a company of two collegues.

We make predictable full-stack websites, with predictable deadlines, and resources.

## CLIENTS

Anyone with hard problems. We are ready to work with each and every client.

## PLACE

We can know each other, or you can know us either by [github](https://github.com/naissur), or common projects.

## PRICE

The cost is **30%** higher than average on the freelance market, or individual agencies.

## GOAL

To join forces: in making what is **in our common interests**; and **avoid making thigs which any one of us dislikes**.


## OUR PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS

- **Clarity in communication**
- Use **battle-tested tools and methods**
- Eliminate **painful spots**
- We make predictable **business**. That means, we make a tool for **solving a specific problem**
- **Business** >= product + clients
- **Programming** is, first of all, a tool, solving a problem.
- **Problems** are solved in the **most efficient way possible**, when this manifesto allows for it.
- **Client's problem** is an optimization problem with **objective criteria**.
- **Problem criteria**: *bounded, predictable* risks and *unbounded, unpredictable benefits*
- When this document fails to resolve a conflict, the desicion is first made by the client, then by the CEO.
