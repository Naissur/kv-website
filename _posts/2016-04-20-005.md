# Perfume, programming, errors, validation, work, night, time, flies

## Can we take rules from perfume art and mixing music, and apply them in programming to create products more efficiently?

## 4+ rule in perfume art

Mixing a new perfume can be done with a 4+ rule:

- take **one main scent**
- add one more, so that both are **recognizeable in the mix**, and they **complement each other**
- **add three, or more** in the same way

## 4+ rule in music

Music can be mixed in the same manner:

- take **vocals track** (assumed to be main)
- **add guitar** (or other track), so that both vocals and guitar are **recognizeable in the mix**, and **complement each other**
- add **bass**
- add **drums**

Obviously, there are more factors to a *good* music mix, such as:

- groove
- lyrics
- frequency space,

But at least this gives you a great start: to get some basic experience and work going.


## 4+ rule: generalized

But, you can see that the main idea of *4+* is common in these areas of art.
This is the same in *movie making, food, books, web design, etc*. - every form of art, where
**user has to span his (rather limited) atttention across some object, or a system of objects**.

## Can we use 4+ rule to programmming?

*Of course!* You can make MVP (from lean startup) in this manner:

- take **one main feature**
- implement it to be more-or-less stable
- **complement it with another feature**, so that both main and second are **recognizeable in the product**, and **complement each other**
- add 2 more complementary, recognizeable features
- release MVP, get **feedback**
- **analyze feedback**,
- **make a turn**, or improve by implementing another feature / fixing bugs.

This resonates with lessons, learned from *Lean Startup* methodology, which tell
how to make startups happen in a **more scientific** and **cheaper manner**.
After all *science* is nothing but an exocortex of making fit models from
arbitary hypotheses.
