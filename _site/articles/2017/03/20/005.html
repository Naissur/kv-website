<h2 id="can-we-take-rules-from-perfume-art-and-mixing-music-and-apply-them-in-programming-to-create-products-more-efficiently">Can we take rules from perfume art and mixing music, and apply them in programming to create products more efficiently?</h2>

<h2 id="rule-in-perfume-art">4+ rule in perfume art</h2>

<p>Mixing a new perfume can be done with a 4+ rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take <strong>one main scent</strong></li>
  <li>add one more, so that both are <strong>recognizeable in the mix</strong>, and they <strong>complement each other</strong></li>
  <li><strong>add three, or more</strong> in the same way</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rule-in-music">4+ rule in music</h2>

<p>Music can be mixed in the same manner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take <strong>vocals track</strong> (assumed to be main)</li>
  <li><strong>add guitar</strong> (or other track), so that both vocals and guitar are <strong>recognizeable in the mix</strong>, and <strong>complement each other</strong></li>
  <li>add <strong>bass</strong></li>
  <li>add <strong>drums</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, there are more factors to a <em>good</em> music mix, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>groove</li>
  <li>lyrics</li>
  <li>frequency space,</li>
</ul>

<p>But at least this gives you a great start: to get some basic experience and work going.</p>

<h2 id="rule-generalized">4+ rule: generalized</h2>

<p>But, you can see that the main idea of <em>4+</em> is common in these areas of art.
This is the same in <em>movie making, food, books, web design, etc</em>. - every form of art, where
<strong>user has to span his (rather limited) atttention across some object, or a system of objects</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="can-we-use-4-rule-to-programmming">Can we use 4+ rule to programmming?</h2>

<p><em>Of course!</em> You can make MVP (from lean startup) in this manner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take <strong>one main feature</strong></li>
  <li>implement it to be more-or-less stable</li>
  <li><strong>complement it with another feature</strong>, so that both main and second are <strong>recognizeable in the product</strong>, and <strong>complement each other</strong></li>
  <li>add 2 more complementary, recognizeable features</li>
  <li>release MVP, get <strong>feedback</strong></li>
  <li><strong>analyze feedback</strong>,</li>
  <li><strong>make a turn</strong>, or improve by implementing another feature / fixing bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>This resonates with lessons, learned from <em>Lean Startup</em> methodology, which tell
how to make startups happen in a <strong>more scientific</strong> and <strong>cheaper manner</strong>.
After all <em>science</em> is nothing but an exocortex of making fit models from
arbitary hypotheses.</p>
