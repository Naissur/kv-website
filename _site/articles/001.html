      <h2>Pitch, font, typographics, 2 years, business, meeting, music, work, money.</h2>
      <p>
        What is a <b>pitch</b>? Can you explain the structure and goals of your business in 30 seconds?
        Having such constraints, you don't think immediately of unimportant details, and <b>communicate the inner meaning</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same happens when a drummer is given a constrain of playing a solo only on a smaller tom, and a kick.
        Immediately, there is a central groove (<b>idea</b>), which is wrapped with details afterwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, the structure of a <b>perfectly pitched</b> business fits :)
      </p>

        The meeting is going to be terrific. With blackjack, Erlang/OTP, and Elixir.

        How to pitch Erlang in a few sentences
      </h3>
      <p>
        There used to be a set of problems 20 years ago: <b>programming fault-tolarant, non-fragile software is damn hard</b>.
        Hence, guys from Erlang were intrigued, and solved it in their language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds interesting, right? (<b>Especially after 20 years of programming in CPP</b>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The meeting is going to be terrific. With plans, programmming and coffee.
        Just like in the passing light of day.
      </p>
